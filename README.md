## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

## Process

- Mobile-first design. Using flex.
- JS: used AI first - frustrating, then moved to research. Found [How to Create a Collapsible](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_collapsible) on W3Schools which was helpful. I followed that as a template.
- `button` is an array here?
- Found `hsl(281, 83%, 54%)` from Illustrator file SVG.
- I think the `h2` is included in the `button` element. The whole area is clickable, not just the icon itself...
- I had swapped out the `<header>` bg-img for a `<picture>` element, and then learnt that semantically, that doesn't make sense, so switched it back and used media queries to swap out the bg into the desktop-version and used `background-size: cover;` to make it cover the whole width of the viewport.

## Lessons

1. JS - `console.log(this.parentElement.nextSiblingElement)` returned `cannot read properties of undefined nextSiblingElement`.
2. JS - `console.log(this.parentElement)` returned `undefined`.

## Development

- I don't know what `this` keyword means.
